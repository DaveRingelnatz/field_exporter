# field_exporter
Prometheus Exporter for Carriota Field API metrics

## Latest Changes:

### April 4, 2018
* minor bugfixes

### April 3, 2018
* initial version published

## What does it do?

Works with [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) to export metrics from [Carriota Field APIs](http://field.carriota.com/) and pulls metrics from [Bitfinex's webservice API](https://docs.bitfinex.com/v2/docs) for required IOTA price data.

The following images are from my field_exporter dashboard. The top looks like this:

The next section contains season history data and data summaries of all my nodes:

Nuriel Shem-Tov has a great installer which deploys, among other things, IOTA IRI, IOTA PM, Grafana, Prometheus, IOTA Prometheus Exporter, Field and this Exporter. Please visit his docs if your intent is to get the whole stack up and running as easily as possible: [IRI-Playbook](http://iri-playbook.readthedocs.io/en/master/introduction.html) 

[IOTA Partners](http://iota.partners/) also has a copy+paste installation playbook that is also great. Check out both and decide which one is right for you.

## Dependencies

* Node JS: version >= 8.0 (due to async await use)
* Prometheus:  Here is a [great guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-prometheus-on-ubuntu-16-04)
* Grafana: version >= 5.0

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/DaveRingelnatz/field_exporter.git
cd field_exporter
npm install
```

You need to configure the following values to use field_exporter in `config.js`:

* field_node_public_id (example entry: "field_node_public_id: 'yourpublicidhere',")
* field_nodes_multiple_ids (example config: "field_nodes_public_ids_array: ['publicId1','publicId2',")

The exporter is configured to run on port `9337` so as to comply with the list of [export default ports](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/wiki/Default-port-allocations)

Once installed and working you have to edit the Prometheus config file - `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml` and add a section like the below:

```
# field_exporter section
- job_name: 'field_exporter'
    scrape_interval: 30s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9337']
```
Please don't set the scrape_interval below `30s` value because this value already implies about ~3000 request per day to the carriota field APIs.

You need to restart the Prometheus service `sudo service prometheus restart` (or `sudo systemctl restart prometheus`) after adding an exporter.

## Run the field_exporter

Within install dir type

```
node field_exporter.js
```
Note: field_exporter is only running as long as bash is open. As soon as you disconnect the field_exporter will be killed.
Use "screen -S field_exporter" to start new screen, type command there and deattach by pressing "CTRL + A + D". Then you can disconnect SSH session (use "screen -r" to reattach to the session if you are connected by ssh again). 

Test if all works fine by navigating to http://localhost:9337/metrics. If you get back data, field_exporter is running.

## Grafana

Once the above is done, the metrics will be available to be consumed in a Grafana dashboard which must be added (see folder `dashboards`).
